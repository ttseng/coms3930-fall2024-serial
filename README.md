# COMS 3930 Serial Communication Example

1. Load `serial-button > serial-button.ino` onto your ESP32
2. Try out `processing > serial_button_viz > serial_button_viz.pde` in Processing
3. Try out `web-serial > webSerial.html` in Chrome

## Note
You can only have one serial connection to your ESP32 at a time!  If you get an error, make sure you have other connections closed out (which can include the Arduino serial monitor, your Processing sketch, or the Web Serial connection)
